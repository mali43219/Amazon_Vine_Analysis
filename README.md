# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

overview: 
The objective of this project is to examine Amazon reviews authored by individuals who are part of the Amazon Vine program, which offers manufacturers and publishers the opportunity to obtain feedback on their products and detect any partiality in the reviews given by Vine members compared to non-members.

Manufacturers pay Amazon and can give complimentary items to Vine members, who are obligated to post a review. To assess whether there is a favorable bias in reviews from Vine members versus non-members, it is necessary to determine the percentage of 5-star ratings in relation to the total number of ratings. The analysis required selecting 1 of  50 datasets for extraction, transformation, and loading into a dataframe to perform the analysis.


Results:

How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
    there are 94 vine reviews and  40471 non-vine reviews.

How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
    there are 48 5-star vine reviews and 15663 5-star non-vine reviews.
